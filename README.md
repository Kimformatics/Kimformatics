## Welcome! üëãüèæ

Hi I'm Dr. Kimberly Deas a Prinicpal Level Data Scientist / Informaticist, Chemist / Computational Toxocologist, Health Disparities Researcher, and passionate Data Educator living in the Metro DC area. 

## My Career and What I Do
In my career journey, I have had a number of roles, including Lab Director, Bench Research Scientist, Chemical Informatics Manager, Health Data Analyst, and now Prinicpal Informaticist / Clinical Data Scientist.

## Professional and Academic Background üéì
I'm a Principal Analytics Research Scientist with a PhD in Biomedical Informatics, Masters degrees in Chemistry and Pharmacology, and over 10 years in Data Science and 20 years in scientific research, specializing in Health Disparities. Currently pursuing an MSE in Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, I have combined expertise in Chemical Informatics, Computational Toxicology, Health Disparities, and Health Data Science which I plan to use in the future to address critical environmental health challenges in vulnerable communities. My current personal projects focus on PFAS detection in environmental samples and computational screening of mutagenic impurities, using advanced AI/ML techniques, predictive analytics, and data visualization tools. With professional experience spanning Clinical Data Science to Chemical Informatics, my goal is to leverage my interdisciplinary background to identify and quantify disproportionate environmental health impacts on vulnerable communities through innovative Data Science approaches.

## Advocacy and Outreach

Understanding and benefiting from the power of community and representation, I frequently share my professional experiences on LinkedIn and curate newsletters in Computational and Environmental Toxicology, Chemical Informatics, Healthcare Data Science, and Health Disparities. Through these platforms, I share insights, latest research findings, and analyses using cutting-edge data analytics tools to foster deeper understanding among professionals and enthusiasts alike. I am committed to uplifting and expanding the representation of women and racial and gender minorities in STEM fields, working to ensure they have access to the networks and knowledge needed to excel and thrive in their careers.
